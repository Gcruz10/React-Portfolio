            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Gabriel Cruz, a dedicated coding enthusiast on the journey to becoming a skilled full stack developer. With a strong foundation in coding and a burning curiosity for technology, I'm excited to take my passion to the next level and forge a fulfilling career in the world of web development.As a Edx student, I've immersed myself in the intricacies of coding, both on the front-end and back-end. From crafting elegant user interfaces using modern frameworks to building robust server-side logic, I've embraced the full spectrum of development. Every line of code I write is a step toward honing my craft and creating meaningful digital experiences. What drives me? The thrill of problem-solving and the ever-evolving nature of the tech landscape. I find solace in debugging a complex issue and pride in turning ideas into functional applications. I'm a firm believer in the power of continuous learning, and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skill set. Beyond the code, I'm an advocate for clean design and user-centric experiences. I understand that great software isn't just about functionality; it's about creating seamless, delightful interactions that resonate with users.As I embark on this exciting journey, I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate, learn from industry professionals, and contribute my unique perspective to innovative projects. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of working together!
